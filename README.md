### How to use SVG into Blender 3D

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a free and open-source vector graphics editor used to create vector images, primarily in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. Other formats can be imported and exported.

I will inform you about the protocol to import an SVG into blender 3D attaching the Inkscape and Blender files.

### Operating System and Software

- Debian and Fedora

- Inkscape 1.2

## Librsvg
- [Librsvg](https://github.com/GNOME/librsvg) a library to render SVG images to Cairo surfaces. GNOME uses this to render SVG icons. Outside of GNOME, other desktop environments use it for similar purposes. It is also used in Wikimedia to render the SVG images that appear in Wikipedia, so that even old web browsers can display them. Many projects which casually need to render static SVG images use librsvg.

## Protocols

To deploy this project run

```bash
  Open Inkscape
